Blackjack Game
Welcome to the Blackjack Game! This is a simple browser-based game where you play against a dealer to see who can get closer to a hand value of 21 without going over.

Game Logic
Objective
The goal of the game is to have a hand value that is closer to 21 than the dealer’s hand without exceeding 21.

Rules
Each player starts with two cards.
Cards 2 through 10 are worth their face value.
Jacks, Queens, and Kings are worth 10 points.
Aces are worth either 1 or 11 points, depending on which value is more advantageous to the hand.
Players can choose to either "hit" (draw another card) or "stand" (keep their current hand).
If the player’s hand exceeds 21 points, they "bust" and lose the round.
After the player finishes, the dealer must play. The dealer must hit until their hand totals 17 or more points.
If neither the player nor the dealer busts, the one closest to 21 wins.
Game Flow
The player is first dealt two cards, and then they can either hit (get another card) or stand (keep their hand).
After the player finishes their turn, the dealer plays according to the game rules.
If the player busts (exceeds 21), they automatically lose.
After both turns are completed, the game compares the player’s and dealer’s hands to determine the winner.
